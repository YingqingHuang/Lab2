           I was doing on pig.py <br />
           I put two lines "print() <br />
                            print("Player:", player_total, "Computer:", comp_total)"  <br />
           into the outer while loop and deleted those in both inner while loops.
           I made these changes because these two lines will compile anyway, so writing them twice looks redundant.      <br />
           Also I deleted "and not done" in the inner while loops, since this statement has already been processed in the outer loop.          <br />
